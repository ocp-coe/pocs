Proof of Concepts
------------------

- Steps for POC
	Qualify the need for a POC and sync with AE's to ensure an opportunity is registered in SalesForce
	Open the OpenShift SF opportuity and select the "Create Proof of Concept" tab near the Opportunity Detail section.  

	** If the tab does not show up on your opportunity you probably don't have the right SF permissions.  You will need to go through the pain of updating your SF license to include this functionaltiy by opening a ticket [here](https://redhat.service-now.com/rh_ess/home.do)**
